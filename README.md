# SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-PROJECT

Description:
As part of our second-semester software development course, our team undertook the development of a comprehensive Mentoring System tailored for SSN College of Engineering. 
This system facilitates seamless communication and collaboration between mentors, mentees, and managers. The key features include:

Mentor Dashboard:
Mentors can view all assigned mentees, enabling them to manage mentee details, schedule meetings, and maintain mentee records.

Mentee Interface:
Mentees have access to their personal details and can request meetings with their mentors. Confidential information is securely handled to ensure privacy.

Meeting Management:
Mentors can schedule, update, and capture meeting details with their mentees, fostering effective mentorship.

Manager Reports:
Managers can generate various reports based on mentee records, providing valuable insights for program evaluation and improvement.

Technology Stack:

Python
Django Framework
HTML
CSS
Data Structures (Emphasis on Trees)

This project not only showcases our technical skills in Python, Django, and front-end development but also highlights our ability to design and implement
a practical solution to address the unique requirements of a mentoring system. It emphasizes the importance of data structures, particularly trees, in organizing
and managing mentee-mentor relationships efficiently.
